# Hola, I'm [Frances](https://francescoronel.com)! 🍓 🍫

I am currently a software engineer specializing in UI development on the Customer Acquisition Team at [Slack](https://francescoronel.com/2018/06/04/slack/) where my mission is to make your working life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. 💬

I have been working professionally as a developer since 2015 and hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Hampton University](https://francescoronel.com/2016/05/04/hampton-university/) and a Master's in Computer Science from [Cornell Tech](https://francescoronel.com/2017/05/26/cornell-tech/). 🎓

Outside of Slack, I volunteer as Technology Director and an Advisory Board Member for [Techqueria](https://techqueria.org), a nonprofit that serves the largest global community of Latinx professionals in tech. 🌮
