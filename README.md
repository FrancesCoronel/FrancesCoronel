# Hola, I'm Frances! 🍓 🍫

I am currently a software engineer specializing in UI development on the Customer Acquisition Team at [Slack](https://fvcproductions.com/2018/06/04/slack/) where my mission is to make your working life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. 💬

I have been working professionally as a developer since 2015 and hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Hampton University](https://fvcproductions.com/2016/05/04/hampton-university/) and a Master's in Computer Science from [Cornell Tech](https://fvcproductions.com/2017/05/26/cornell-tech/). 🎓

Outside of Slack, I am an Executive Director of [Techqueria](https://fvcproductions.com/2018/04/24/techqueria/), a 501c3 nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx in Tech in the US. 🌮
