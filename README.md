# Hola, I'm [Frances](https://francescoronel.com)! 🍓🍫

<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4284691/187105470-49c5c520-b307-4a06-9965-5d8fe8763965.png">

I'm a senior software engineer, a fierce advocate for diversity in tech, and a doting Corgi mom. 👩🏽‍💻

I have over six years of full-time software engineering experience with a heavy focus on product and web frontend development. My specialties lie in growth engineering, design systems, and accessibility. 🛠️

Outside work, I enjoy speaking, teaching, and mentoring to lead by example and inspire the next generation of software engineers. 🚀

I am based in Inglewood, California, with my partner and our two Corgis, Luna & Sueño. 🐾

I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, and I identify as Peruvian-American. 🇵🇪

I am passionate about supporting and uplifting Latinx professionals in tech (especially Latina software engineers), employee resource groups, and software engineering apprentices. 💛
