# Hola, I'm [Frances](https://francescoronel.com)! 🍓🍫

<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4284691/187105470-49c5c520-b307-4a06-9965-5d8fe8763965.png">

I'm a senior software engineer, a fierce advocate for diversity in tech, and a doting Corgi mom. 👩🏽‍💻

I started learning how to code in 2013 and I have been working full-time since June 2017 with a heavy focus on frontend development on product and growth teams.

Outside work, I enjoy speaking and mentoring to lead by example and inspire the next generation of software engineers. 🚀

I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area with my two Corgis, Luna & Sueño. 🐾

I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, and I identify as Peruvian-American. 🇵🇪

I am passionate about supporting and uplifting other Latino software engineers. 💛

## GitHub

I've enjoyed having my work published through GitHub's ReadME project.

**Story**

My open source journey is featured on [GitHub's README blog](https://github.com/readme/stories/frances-coronel).

**Guide**

[ONWARD: A framework for maintaining maintainers](https://github.com/readme/guides/onward-maintainer-framework) was published as a GitHub ReadME guide.

**Podcast**

I gave my two cents on the art of finding your open source mentor on [the ReadME Podcast](https://github.com/readme/podcast/open-source-minimalism) (18:20).

I also gave a shout-out to a [fellow maintainer](https://github.com/EllaCodes4) for her work on [Latina Dev](https://latina.dev) on another [README Podcast](https://github.com/readme/podcast/kelsey-hightower) (43:20).
